1. Identifying Unnecessary Services
Step-by-Step Process
1.1List All Enabled Services Use systemctl to list services and their statuses:
    sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled

Analyze the list and determine which services are unnecessary based on your system's purpose. For example:

Desktop environments might have services like cups (printing) or bluetooth enabled, which may not be needed for a server.
Web servers might not need GUI-related services.

1.2. Check Active Services To see running services:
     sudo systemctl --type=service --state=running

Cross-check the running services with your requirements.

1.3. Disable Services If you identify a service that isnâ€™t required, disable it:
     sudo systemctl disable <service-name>

1.4. Audit Boot-Time Services Use systemd-analyze blame to identify services that consume time during boot:
     systemd-analyze blame






2. Identifying Unnecessary Packages
2.1 List Installed Packages To view all installed packages:
  dpkg --get-selections

Or, for a more concise list:
  apt list --installed

2.2 Identify Orphaned Packages Use deborphan to find orphaned packages (those that were installed as dependencies but are no longer needed):
  sudo apt install deborphan
  deborphan

2.3 Check for Manual and Automatic Installations Use apt-mark to differentiate packages installed manually and automatically:
  apt-mark showmanual
  apt-mark showauto

2.4 Uninstall Unnecessary Packages If a package is no longer needed:
  sudo apt remove <package-name>

2.5 To clean up dependencies that are no longer required:
  sudo apt autoremove

2.6 Use Tools for Package Analysis
popularity-contest (optional): Shows the most and least used packages on the system.
  sudo apt install popularity-contest
  popularity-contest

2.7 Find Large Unused Files or Applications Identify large, unused packages with:
  sudo du -sh /usr/* | sort -h

3. Use Tools for Simplified Analysis
System Monitoring Tools
  htop or top: Identify running processes and their associated services or applications.
  ncdu: A disk usage analyzer to spot large files and directories.
    sudo apt install ncdu
    ncdu /

Automated Cleanup Tools
bleachbit: For cleaning temporary files and unused data.
Stacer: A GUI-based tool for system optimization and service/package management.
